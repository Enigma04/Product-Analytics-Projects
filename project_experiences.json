    "title": "Customer Churn Prediction Model",
    "description": "Led a project to predict customer churn for a telecom client using historical usage data and customer support interactions. I performed feature engineering on temporal patterns, built a logistic regression baseline, and eventually deployed a Random Forest model with an AUC of 0.89. Worked with the DevOps team to containerize the model with Docker and schedule weekly retraining using Airflow. The model insights helped reduce churn by 12% over the next quarter.",

    "description": "Built a collaborative filtering recommendation engine using implicit user behavior from online store logs. Extracted product-view sequences and co-purchase patterns to design a matrix factorization model using the `implicit` library in Python. Later refactored the model using TensorFlow embeddings and evaluated recommendations using NDCG. The engine was integrated into the homepage experience and increased cross-sell by 9% within the first month.",

    "description": "Managed a team of 4 data analysts in a six-month migration of Excel-based reports to a centralized BI stack (Tableau + Snowflake). Coordinated directly with finance, marketing, and HR to rework reporting logic and metrics definitions. Conducted stakeholder workshops, maintained project roadmap, and trained business users post-launch. Improved report reliability and cut manual effort by 70%, freeing up analysts for strategic projects.",

Preprocessed text data using spaCy and fine-tuned a BERT model to classify sentiment with over 85% accuracy. Built a Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring, and presented biweekly insights to the marketing team. The system enabled proactive responses to trending issues and informed campaign messaging.",
