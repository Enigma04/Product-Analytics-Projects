    "title": "Customer Churn Prediction Model",
    "description": "Led a project to predict customer churn for a telecom client using historical usage data and customer support interactions. I performed feature engineering on temporal patterns, built a logistic regression baseline, and eventually deployed a Random Forest model with an AUC of 0.89. Worked with the DevOps team to containerize the model with Docker and schedule weekly retraining using Airflow. The model insights helped reduce churn by 12% over the next quarter.",
